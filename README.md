Common components and libraries to use in our front-end applications

## 📖 About this

This repository is a monorepo, which consists of all design-system packages for our entire presentation layer. You can install each package separately, or the whole design system if you want.

Use those resources in your front-end applications to create a consistent visual signature for our products.

## 👽 Prerequisites

To install and use our design system packages, you must follow these steps:

### 1. Configure your Github Packages access token

We're using Github Packages to host our design-system resources. We've applied some of the required configurations in the `.npmrc` file at this repository, but you may need to add your token.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't add your token directly to the `.npmrc` file of this repository. You should add it to the `~/.npmrc` file in your home directory.

To learn more about Github Packages configuration, check [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages).

### 2. Install the required software

To use our design system, you need the following tools in your workstation:

* [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
* [asdf-yarn](https://github.com/twuni/asdf-yarn)

### 3. Install the required software for the desired package

Each package contains a list of peer dependencies that you must install in your project before using them. They're listed on the package's README file. Take a look there!
